dave if you ve a minute i d like your advice on something sure what is it
well it s nothing really important but it s annoying what s up
what s up it s about my salary cheques
it s possible well what do you think we ought to do about it
well what do you think we ought to do about it i don t think we should make any fuss about it yet i m sure they ll straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training no i never did either
i don t think we should make any fuss about it yet i m sure they ll straighten it out i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i suppose the idea was specialized training i suppose so though of course there s a more sinister explanation
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out no as a matter of fact i didn t
i don t know all i heard is that there s something about the mission we weren t told that seems very unlikely
that seems very unlikely yes i thought so
yes but it s to fantastic to think that they d keep something from us i know it would be almost inconceivable
yes i thought so of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
i know it would be almost inconceivable but not completely inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable i suppose it isn t logically impossible
i suppose it isn t logically impossible i guess it isn t
i guess it isn t still all we have to do is ask hal
well that s something yes i don t know what to make of it
yes i don t know what to make of it i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes but it s more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low anyway it s just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong yes but it s more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
good morning how s it going are you reasonably awake

you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition yes i know
you probably also know that we found them okay yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
i m not questioning your word dave but it s just not possible i m not capable of being wrong hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem
i m sorry about the misunderstanding hal well don t worry about it
well don t worry about it and don t you worry about it
and don t you worry about it is your confidence in me fully restored
yes it is hal well that s a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
is your confidence in me fully restored yes it is hal
too bad about frank isn t it yes it is

the antenna has to be replaced repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation

excuse me skipper yes griff
sidearms but the saucer s dead we hope
yes griff all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
skipper could you take a look here something wrong
something wrong the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash why do you say that
why do you say that we re dead in the water but it indicates we re moving
we re dead in the water but it indicates we re moving what
we read you go ahead doctor they re inside the saucer it s filled with breathable air wonderful
wonderful that s wonderful carl reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose
now they feel it down below radiation level constantly rising
excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a one in a thousand shot anything
it doesn t seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center under u water u
above murmansk and finland suppose our theorizing is correct then this u could u be the next danger point
suppose our theorizing is correct then this u could u be the next danger point what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit perhaps be lying there waiting
the radiation level from the saucer it s rising what direction does the system indicate
as we near the pole there s got to be an explanation
there s got to be an explanation there is i believe our friend cyclops is returning to life
all ready as ready as we u can u be i ll report to the skipper
i m afraid i have some bad news for you reef you ll have to share quarters this trip who with
who with dr neilsen he ll be
what do you think i think i should have joined the air force
determine extent of damage immediately after torpedo room report
you re sure it s cyclops take a look
right u at u him that s what i said
what s the running time thirty four seconds
that s what i said but what can we accomplish
but what can we accomplish we can u ram u him
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots nothing we can do now
what s the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole minus three
remove your weapons commander and come here alone come where
that s a u face u point of view is everything to us u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you
point of view is everything to us u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you tell me something why can u i u hear you when the others couldn t
why not me what am i the closing act on the contrary i want you unharmed perfect
it is a living thing when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself that s why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
that s why no water leaked inside when we rammed you of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage
obviously u that u might be a u little u u rough u
to navigate won t you have to see your way obviously
my yeoman will show you to your quarters thank you
we ve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times but u answers u are what we need not more questions

to love you until death to subscribe to all your commands the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
to make me wretched in two weeks to love you until death to subscribe to all your commands
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me if i do not know it i am innocent

yes but i am afraid of being deceived poor man and for that reason you want to begin where people end

okay i think that s it he rises and walks to the door mr hardy
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten
how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten can i go to jail for punching a guy who s been shot
epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer my heart weeps
is it the truth there s that word again as i told you i wasn t in the room when everyone started shooting
something funny levi i was just thinking of what s going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
jail if he s lucky the gas chamber if he s not i didn t do anything
how do you know because i was standing next to him
or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him i didn t

this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator and here you are going out of house how s that make you feel jules
i m assuming that s what made him the dead one cadet roberto r nunez killed right in front of me
which gives us about five hours why d you call me the guy in interrogation said he d only talk to a cop
the guy in interrogation said he d only talk to a cop and i m the closest thing to it right
he s not done by a longshot i can get more out of him he can wait kendall s out of surgery
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez who killed pike
who killed pike someone must have got a shot off he wasn t exactly a moving target
we ve already been over the terrain twice nothing there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it

you mean not enough to save you jag gets here in three hours try for the confession

it was for suspicion of bribery it s really all in the wording wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i m not comfortable having you involved in this
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i m not comfortable having you involved in this subtlety really isn t one of you finer points is it osborne
levi who names their kid levi senator jonathan kendall of ohio

i just he came back for kendall i don t think he s capable of murder everyone s capable of murder osborne
goddammit hardy you can t just leave watch me
why the fuck wasn t he in restraints i don t know
watch me you said you owed styles and now you re gonna turn your back on him
at least you and kendall agree on that what happened next
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent and if they re asked that s what they ll tell the world
kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin buttfucks the cabin
that bugs you too little bit
little bit let s go talk to bill
are you sure positive hardy they planned this
we re fucked i know they got their stories straight
why don t you talk to levi off the record for a second good idea
i pushed him too hard you couldn t have known

we were back on after you cut her loose
after you cut her loose she walked

key key what is the key no no the key the key to the fail safe lock
where s the fail safe key the key
the key where is it what did you do with it
where is it what did you do with it i don t have it i don t know where it is
i don t have it i don t know where it is you must have it you idiot we can stop the bomb

we ve got to disarm the bomb doolittle are you there
what was that i didn t hear it s talby he s drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
what the hell yoo hoo bomb

well now what what do you have for us now boiler not much nothing at all in this sector
not much nothing at all in this sector find me something i don t care where it is
find me something i don t care where it is well i show a 95 probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula

can you beat that i always knew talby was weird talby can you read me
energy shielding positive function swell let s synchronize detonation time do you know when you re supposed to go off
swell let s synchronize detonation time do you know when you re supposed to go off detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
check at six minutes arm yourself bomb
one hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding energy shielding positive function
energy shielding positive function do you remember the detonation time
do you remember the detonation time detonation in twenty minutes
detonation in twenty minutes right that synchronizes here okay bomb arm yourself
but you can t explode in the bomb bay it s foolish you ll kill us all there s no reason for it i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes detonation will occur at the programmed time
therefore i shall ignore you hello bomb
hello bomb false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you
false data can act only as a distraction therefore i shall refuse to perceive you hey bomb
hey bomb the only thing which exists is myself
snap out of it bomb in the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
hey bomb and i saw that i was alone
hello bomb are you with me of course
of course are you willing to entertain a few concepts
are you willing to entertain a few concepts i am always receptive to suggestions
i am always receptive to suggestions fine think about this one then how do you know you exist
well of course i exist but how do you know you exist
but how do you know you exist it is intuitively obvious
it is intuitively obvious intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
intuition is no proof what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence hmm well i think therefore i am
hmm well i think therefore i am that s good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists
that s good very good now then how do you know that anything else exists my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
exactly why that would mean i really don t know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
why that would mean i really don t know what the outside universe is like at all for certain that s it
that s it intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
intriguing i wish i had more time to discuss this matter why don t you have more time
why don t you have more time because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
now bomb consider this next question very carefully what is your one purpose in life to explode of course
to explode of course and you can only do it once right
and you can only do it once right that is correct
that is correct and you wouldn t want to explode on the basis of false data would you
and you wouldn t want to explode on the basis of false data would you of course not
yes well so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate i recall distinctly the detonation order my memory is good on matters like these
so if you detonate in nine seconds
nine seconds you may be doing so on the basis of false data
you may be doing so on the basis of false data i have no proof that it was false data
i have no proof that it was false data you have no proof that it was correct data
ah what d you say pinback mafhkin oble groop
mafhkin oble groop ah what was that again i still can t hear you
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction i ll check it
pinback yes doolittle
yes doolittle your ghf reading is minus fifteen
your ghf reading is minus fifteen doolittle
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark in a second
in a second boiler can you set me up with some temp figures

i can t seem to locate the malfunction exactly waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water ridin the wall just perfect
waves would be peaking really high and glassy hit that water ridin the wall just perfect somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits i guess i miss the waves and my board most of all
don t worry about it we ll find out when it goes bad i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important
i really think i should try and locate it immediately might be something important i wish i had my board with me now even if i could only polish it once in awhile

ballast i am your best friend i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
that means top secret cooper i heard it
i can see why they sent you along so if the ship didn t blow up what happened
you still need the rope i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins i d rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it now step aside old man
do you copy uh yeah coop i m still here
uh yeah coop i m still here shit do not do that where the fuck are you
time to play spam in the can don t start with me cooper
you can call him baby bear he loves that this is cooper what the hell do you do on this ship anyway
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission everybody shut up let the man speak
from what you re convinced the crew could still be alive after seven years
come on skipper i already put my shoes on you ve had plenty eva coop it s justin s turn stay on station if anything happens
you ve had plenty eva coop it s justin s turn stay on station if anything happens i ll be all over it
we have a man down coop where are you
coop where are you the containment second containment
the containment second containment hold on coop
but justin i ll get him
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before you prep the gravity couches i m going to manually arm those explosives
captain miller we re ready to repressurize the clark on my way
you prep the gravity couches i m going to manually arm those explosives will it work
will it work it worked for weir prep the tanks
you heard me this ship it s crazy trying to go faster n light that s like the tower of babel shit smith you re going biblical on me
shit smith you re going biblical on me you know what happened to the tower of babel don t you it fell down
you know what happened to the tower of babel don t you it fell down you re sucking too much nitrogen in your mix
we ll have to re route through the port conduit to the apu what about the accumulator
it s holding she s holding we re still venting trace gasses gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole
solid as a rock hey smith smith clear that airlock man i m coming in
smith clear that airlock man i m coming in roger that
it was like nothing was there and then justin appeared and the core became metal no he didn t
no he didn t you weren t there i saw it
i don t know what happened to justin i m telling you i saw it
i m telling you i saw it what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion i know what i saw and it wasn t a fucking optical effect
what s happening i don t know the screens are dead
is that an offer it is not
let me breathe let me breathe you re okay now it s over
how the bridge is gone there must be a way what about engineering
there must be a way what about engineering can you shut it down
can you shut it down i don t know the process dr weir was the expert
i don t know the process dr weir was the expert i don t want to go where the last crew went i d rather be dead
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared
he ll live if we ever make it back we ll make it
what is it i ve been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
they thought it said liberatis me save me but it s not me it s tutemet save yourself it s not a distress call it s a warning
it s not a distress call it s a warning it gets worse
do you hear it right there hear what
hear what it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell save yourself from hell what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
dj the clark s gone smith and cooper are dead what happened
what happened weir he used one of the explosives from the corridor
please oh god dj what do i how do i
oh god dj what do i how do i please kill
please kill oh god
what s wrong nothing it s nothing
what s happening a power drain
what s wrong you didn t hear it you must have heard it
i ve got a pulse he s alive pressure
pressure 90 over 50 and falling
90 over 50 and falling he s crashing
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood his peritoneum has ruptured
i wouldn t bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and i d codes it s the event horizon she s come back
thank you don t thank me bill i m not doing you any favors
it s not that simple lyle play the recording for dr weir navigation control tried to hail the vessel this was the only response
does he know that what s on your mind
it s been two years since she died he s over it some things you don t get over
i want our best people on this where s miller the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt she s docked in bay four
what justin what shows you it won t stop it goes on and on and on
it won t stop it goes on and on and on what does
what does the dark inside me
it s inside and it eats and eats until there s nothing left the dark inside i don t understand
the dark inside i don t understand from the other place
how do you know all this i built it
you ve reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side we still have pressure the radiation count s steady at 7 millirads an hour
we still have pressure the radiation count s steady at 7 millirads an hour background radiation perfectly safe
i ve reached another containment door this thing s huge that s the second containment seal beyond that engineering
that s the second containment seal beyond that engineering i m going in
everything green on my boards skipper start the countdown
justin finish your sweep almost done i just gotta check one thing
but i can t i gotta get out of here skipper please justin i won t let you die
this is weir dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
since the initial transmission there s been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes the crew could they still be alive
the crew could they still be alive the ship had life support systems for eighteen months they re been gone seven years
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months they re been gone seven years someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship
what s the hold up just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months i put in for a replacement for you but no one
we ve got pressure clear and open on my mark three two one mark
jesus its huge ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
that means they didn t abandon ship so where are they starck any luck with the bio scan
peters is right no one s here i don t know this place is really dark i can t see a thing
i can see the hatch starck you still showing those readings
the blood came from somewhere peters there s no one here skipper
okay i m on the bridge what you got peters
everything s been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull it s intact the science workstation has power i ll see if i can find the crew from here
justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters how s the client
how s the client crystallized
can anybody hear me skipper
skipper peters
peters you okay
you okay yeah i m i m okay
peters i want you to go through the ship s log see if we can t find some answers i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin fine starck i want you to repeat the bio scan
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us i ll get back to the log but on the bridge i won t go back back in there
i ve been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space until then do what you re told and stay out of my way
where has it been for the last seven years that s what we re here to find out
what does it say nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
that s the engineering containment and there s the main airlock we can dock there smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster be careful it s not a load bearing structure
dr weir i need you on the bridge captain i didn t come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
captain i didn t come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship once the ship is secured we ll bring you on board
once the ship is secured we ll bring you on board that is not acceptable
easy peters we re okay we re okay let s finish the sweep captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
it beats dying mister smith dr weir s right get on board the event horizon i ll meet you at the airlock
any survivors negative
what could cause them what s in the core it s complicated
it s complicated how much time do you need we have seventeen hours and forty two minutes now what is in the core
if it worked if it worked yes
i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits there s no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it s under control
you have something dr weir the date
the date what about it
what about it the event horizon s computer think s it s 2034
the event horizon s computer think s it s 2034 it s 2041
it s 2041 exactly the ship s internal clock is off by seven years
what the hell is that dr weir i don t know
is that your expert opinion the only answer we ve had out of you is i don t know justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
we don t get the power back our air s gonna go bad check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
what do you want me to say you said this ship creates a gateway
to what where did this ship go where did you send it i don t know
i don t know where has it been for the past seven years
where has it been for the past seven years i don t know
i don t know the other place what is that
we re leaving you can t your orders are specific
don t don t do this it s done
you you can t do that watch me
i told you she won t let you leave son of a bitch
your eyes i don t need them anymore where we re going we won t need eyes to see
i don t need them anymore where we re going we won t need eyes to see what are you talking about
if you miss me you ll blow out the hull you ll die too what makes you think i ll miss
weir is dead then who the fuck are you
then who the fuck are you your fear do you remember the goliath miller
what are you you know
you know you want me to believe you re the devil well i don t that s bullshit
you want me to believe you re the devil well i don t that s bullshit i m not the devil
i m not the devil then what what are you tell me
then what what are you tell me better if i just show you
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing you re lying
i don t like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go is the course locked in locked and cocked
jesus what is that
heading three three four make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees one four degrees
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings something like that yeah
i guess we re about to find out keep us slow and steady yes sir
yes sir dr weir
we ve got some weather i noticed starck anybody home
1500 meters we re getting too close where is it
proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 we re right on top of it we re gonna hit starck
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby love to
it is now we re locked in starck give me a read
captain miller smith where the hell have you been
smith where the hell have you been we have a situation here
no one s dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks they re gone
do we have enough time for a weld we don t have time to fart
captain miller you copy i m here smith how s the clark
we don t have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air understood
thank you captain we got a problem
captain we got a problem now what
now what she was right behind me i turn around she s gone she could be anywhere
she was right behind me i turn around she s gone she could be anywhere alright prep the clark for launch i ll find her
skipper what is it smith
what is it smith i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark
smith get out of there come again skipper
come again skipper one of the explosives is missing from the corridor i think weir may have put it on the clark
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock no no we just got her back together
no no we just got her back together get out of there now
where is it where is it smith smith fuck
ion drive will engage in t minus ten minutes let s go
starck why aren t you on the bridge i just finished drying
i just finished drying then what are you doing here come on people let s go and cooper put some pants on
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees come around to three three four
something s wrong with the bio scan radiation interference
that s an affirmative keep your eyes open
everybody okay we re all here
we re all here okay let s find out how much time we just bought
it tastes bad but you can breathe it
how much oh two do we have oxygen is not the problem
oxygen is not the problem carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide it s building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
it s building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot we can take the filters from the clark
what s causing the readings i don t know but whatever it is it s not the crew
i can reconfigure the scan for c 12 amylase proteins do it dr weir
maybe one of the original crew no it was someone else
miller what is it starck
bio readings of indeterminate origin don t you have anything useful to tell me i ve got a theory
you ve got to listen to what what are you saying this ship is alive
it s not bullshit it s the only conclusion the data supports starck do you know how crazy that sounds it s impossible
starck do you know how crazy that sounds it s impossible i know that
if you knew it was impossible then why d you waste my time i thought you wanted an answer and that s the only one i have
what i want is to survive the next ten hours nine hours and twenty two minutes
miller come in what s going on in there starck
what s going on in there starck justin s in the airlock
he s awake he s in the airlock he s not wearing a suit stay here don t stop working
i m on my way starck you better hurry he s engaged the override we can t open the inner door
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can five seconds
weir can t be alive whatever was on that bridge wasn t weir
blow the fucker up blow it up
weir activated the drive he s sending us to the other place we ve got to shut it down we ve got to
i ll do it no i ll be right back
we re armed this fucker s ready to blow repeat we re armed
repeat we re armed miller he s back he was in the tank
he s been past mars he served on the goliath
he served on the goliath wasn t that ship destroyed
claire dj it s okay you re okay just breathe
here s another one they re all over the place they re explosive charges
dr weir what s this the door to you re at the bridge ms peters you still haven t seen any crew
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that blood looks like arterial spray
blood looks like arterial spray can you see a body
can you see a body there s no one here
isn t it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge i ve seen bodies before this is different
there s no one in the corridor but us not according to the computer
he s engaged the override can you shut it down
yes yes justin we heard it keep him talking
keep him talking do you know what it was
almost got it come on baby bear open this door
we have to do something oh god skipper justin just activated the door it s on a thirty second delay
you got any coffee it s cold
it s cold i don t care
where is she dead ahead 5000 meters
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker she s not ugly
what the hell is that that s the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship
the safety circuit s failed we re losing atmosphere
i didn t see anything and i don t have to see anything this ship is fucked thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith hey you don t need to be a scientist figure it out
30 hours to neptune orbit all boards are green everything s five by five
you can t do that the law of relativity prohibits faster than light travel
if they are they re screening their calls range 3000 meters and closing
the scope is lit it s right in front of us 1000 meters
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off picking up magnetic interference
what happened to his eyes explosive decompression
explosive decompression decompression wouldn t do that
miller do you read me peters get them back
get them back i m trying goddammit
what if the air has gone bad we can t wear these suits forever i don t think this is a good idea we don t even know what happened on that ship
a straight line wrong the shortest distance between two points
the reactor s still hot we ve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious do they have pressure
what is it ship s log
what is it i don t know the life readings just went off the scale
it must be hard being so far away from her yes i miss her she died two years now
yes i miss her she died two years now i m sorry
what are you doing it wants me i have to go
in our current environment dr weir self control is an asset i m alright please
what is it the forward airlock
the forward airlock miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean it means nothing
i don t think she s real big on hate you wouldn t say that if you could see me
such a sad face you know sometimes being different isn t a bad thing trust me this ain t one of those times
how d you know it was me i m blind not deaf wanna come in
i m not really dressed for a party relax it s casual
relax it s casual no i mean i m a little dusty
those yours too my step dad s i m strictly into stone i was wondering when you d walk by
we re going to have to work on your touch i like the sound of that
you know you could a run an ad in the personals sensual blind chick seeks three ton rock hard he man for deep spiritual relationship
sensual blind chick seeks three ton rock hard he man for deep spiritual relationship this ain t permanent my friend reed s working on a cure i think
i wouldn t know anything about that i mean
way to not overthink it so when do we leave i ll schedule the launch call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
we can monitor the cloud s approach and observe the tests from here is it safe
i can only stay for one drink ben i ve got to meet with victor wouldn t want to keep vic waiting
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped well why didn t you say so you want me to lift some weights or something
you look like an eighties rock band the suit will stretch you should try it
the suit will stretch you should try it i wouldn t be caught dead in that
he didn t oh he did
oh he did what did he do to the uniform
he didn t mean it you know johnny he s always been a hothead it s not him it s them i can t live like this
it s easy for you to be patient no it s not i thought i was done waiting for reed we re all in this together now ben
where is reed victor must ve taken him
what are you doing here i m worried about you
i m worried about you about me how sweet
about me how sweet come on let me buy you something to eat looks like you could use the company
ben come in what is this where s reed
what is this where s reed where do you think with sue
reed said it d be weeks till he also said we d avoid that storm in space and we know how that turned out
i ll be watching over you just get back soon or i start looking for a new groom
deb it s me i need you to step out front out front you home baby i got a surprise for you
oh my g g g what did you do to ben deb it s me it s still me
what did you wish for honey i already got it everything i want
he s financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century you d never know it
i can t take this ben this is business just work
what about his first born ben the money s not important we could save lives
he knew about nasa what if he made the call to shut us down ben think about all the people we can help if this works
ben think about all the people we can help if this works maybe you should think about yourself for once you always let this guy push you round
maybe you should think about yourself for once you always let this guy push you round we got what we wanted that s enough
we got what we wanted that s enough i know i know i m just worried about what he wants speaking of which
can t do it i cannot do it external srbs orbital system engines its just like the shuttles you flew in
they crashed it into a wall a flight simulator i m sure he s matured since then
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do five times
five times i had it at four
i had it at four this makes five
isn t that your speech he s made a few changes
he s made a few changes this is your dream reed you should be the one up there
this is your dream reed you should be the one up there victor s better at these things
i ain t done arranging your flowers egghead ben this is serious turn around
how long was i out three days i was worried about you how are you feeling
i don t know i just keep going over and over the numbers reed even you can t compute every little thing
reed even you can t compute every little thing i should have done more run more tests
you go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life yeah you and debbie and perfect
yeah you and debbie and perfect reed i m not talking about debbie
what come on she s got a good thing with victor i m sorry did that cosmic bath loosen your screws
i m sorry did that cosmic bath loosen your screws he s smart powerful successful
he s smart powerful successful well maybe you should date him
are you alright i think i need to lie down bad shrimp
what the ben are you okay
ben are you okay am i okay you wanna explain that
we had a tough year yeah nine years straight
yeah you don t wanna know the details ben i m afraid i ve got to ask
ben i m afraid i ve got to ask not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your o kay we ll skip that question
it s about to be a broken face this isn t permanent johnny we need to be careful until we re normal again
time for your lesson vic chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal ben got it teach
we re working as hard as we can yeah i can tell victor was right
ben i ve been crunching the numbers on the machine i think if we can rework the power settings forget it egghead i m good as is
if you behave maybe next time daddy ll let you drive keep talking there won t be a next time
please tell me your dawg s not trying to rekindle things with my sister course not strictly business
course not strictly business yeah well his eyes say different
yeah well his eyes say different hey two hearts got busted last time maybe she s not over it either
put your tiny little mind at ease don t you wander off boy
where where am i back on earth victor s medical facility we re in quarantine
back on earth victor s medical facility we re in quarantine reed sue
reed sue they re fine everybody else is fine
they said that s not such a good idea the shock alone could give me the god damn mirror
hey that s a prototype go back to the drawing board
the machine works and vic s gone mister hyde on us really with a name like von doom never saw that one coming
no more cracks about how i look hey i m mr sensitivity now clear the way wide load coming through
like the shields reed said would protect us how long at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks
at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks what do you mean complete
but this disease is progressive degenerative that s terrible news
you re hot so are you
so are you i mean you feel a little feverish
i mean you feel a little feverish i ve never felt better in my life when do you get off work
i ve never felt better in my life when do you get off work my shift ends at four but i couldn t
my shift ends at four but i couldn t meet me at 4 01 top of the run that ll give you a minute to freshen up
me like y stay right left is trouble
stay right left is trouble i though we went over this
i though we went over this last one down springs for room service
you re on fire not this again
not this again no you re on fire
victor s right johnny get to the command center close the shields what about you
he s not responsive ben ben
now what is up with that the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna cool what d it do to you guys
oh you dawg you better not be my nurse ben are you there
this is wrong in so many ways you ve been working out
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who s been through a terrible orde what he s trying to say is every team needs a mascot
twenty from outside the place looks a lot taller oh it is
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes this place is deluxe you got cable
this place is deluxe you got cable and figure out how to reverse them let me show you to your rooms
back it down johnny i can go hotter
is there something about flames about flaming that you what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance
what are you trying to say just because i dress well and like to dance what no i m trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
he s right these costumes are missing something i can t put my finger on it they re not costumes
johnny supernova but all these people
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
apparently i can disappear please tell me you go silent too
stop it okay mom
what is that thing i think that thing is ben
wait you mean there s chance we could be full on 24 7 fantastic grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
grow up johnny you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life is that a trick question c mon i can t be the only one who thinks this is cool
you re really cramping my style here you were at 4000 kelvin any hotter you re approaching supernova
uh we call my sister the invisible girl the invisible girl girl
i m driving dude that s my sister
you re gonna pay for that pebbles what you gave us names what are you the face of the fantastic four now
you two need a time out blockhead started it
johnny did you see ben yeah for the last time i hope i m done with this freak show i m moving back to the real world
yeah for the last time i hope i m done with this freak show i m moving back to the real world is that what you call it real
is that what you call it real at least it beats living in a lab like somebody s science project
johnny slow down think you know mom didn t raise us to look around sis she s not here so you can stop talking to me like i m your little boy

hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away i don t care what ain t nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size
you think the extra strain caused it nah everything was cool it s just one of those things
how about now sixty pounds
sixty pounds what you sure
what you sure that s what it says
that s what it says lemme see
take it easy dodge it s only a piece of metal damn mind of it s own
damn mind of it s own morning skipper
what s so great about sweden it s a beautiful country very clean very civilized and cold
i ain t no mechanic just so you know you find anything that even looks like a compressor i don t care what grab it
yeah but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about we ll see who s dreamin m man
what day is it i don t know tuesday
i don t know tuesday wrong it s friday
when they find out what it s carrying they may not be so interested in what s legal maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
the turbine blew lemme see was that before or after the oil fire
you d think on a ship this size there d be something left to eat after fifty years there ain t nothin left but shoe leather
where from amidships starboard at the beam just under the waterline i don t think it s a problem
one more why not
maureen maureen
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow then we ll all be doomed any other questions
nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either ever heard of insurance big boy
last thing we want is extra partners or uninvited guests
this s gonna hurt a little thanks for the warning ow damn
what other choices have we got i tell you one thing we re not gonna be towing no ship now
guess i ll just keep working what re you crazy
what re you crazy i like my job
light in those passages ain t so good i m telling you i saw somebody i don t know who it was but i saw somebody
maybe that is his boat gimme a break
fifty million dollars fifty million we gonna let this guy just take it from us one guy so we kill him
so we kill him i m saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest
one guy isn t gonna be so stupid maybe he isn t alone
pretty handy with that scatter gun epps you raised on a farm seen a lota movies
other than the obvious there s nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside then what the hell happened to him
try wednesday right wednesday
did you hell no you think i m crazy
what say epps you up for some roasted albatross why not
you aren t jealous are you dodge are you kidding me jealous epps gimme a break
if you get it back in one piece it s a risk i m willing to take
mother fucker what is it
what is it threw a turbine blade
the number one turbine s pretty well trashed number two runs but it s way underpowered how long to fix
how long to fix hard to say i gotta get in there and have a look at least a couple days depending
what s this turbine rotor s shot
i thought you said it was just a blade metal s crystallized gotta replace the whole deal
turbine rotor s shot i thought you said it was just a blade
metal s crystallized gotta replace the whole deal how much longer s that gonna take
how much longer s that gonna take like i always say
like i always say i know i know two ways to do anything
i know i know two ways to do anything the right way and the wrong way
the right way and the wrong way but how long
but how long hard to say
hard to say we gotta get outa here dodge a storm blows up and we re history
we gotta get outa here dodge a storm blows up and we re history i m telling you you don t want to be running that fan like it is
i m telling you you don t want to be running that fan like it is what about running number two by itself
what about running number two by itself it s a full 2500 horses down we couldn t drag that boat down hill on ice with it
it s a full 2500 horses down we couldn t drag that boat down hill on ice with it how long then
how long then i gotta pull the blades and re seat everything in a new rotor
i gotta pull the blades and re seat everything in a new rotor how long
how long three four days
three four days goddamit dodge
went aboard she take a radio
it s a hell of a lot of money what you think there s something funny about it
didn t happen yesterday i ll tell you that torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat then it happened before they scuttled her
or somebody stopped them either way they must ve had a pretty good reason
so what re we gonna do that s the big question right a salvage claim to a vessel s cargo s as valid as a claim to the vessel itself it s ours
a salvage claim to a vessel s cargo s as valid as a claim to the vessel itself it s ours then we re rich we re damn filthy stinking rich
then we re rich we re damn filthy stinking rich it looks like it
you gotta be kidding what the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks so we get a little more for the boat besides the gold ll be safer where it is
yeah yeah i m on it the sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending what s ours
i m buyin me a nice outrigger spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget how about you epps
dreamin s all any of you re gonna be doing if we don t get this boat running yeah yeah
sounds like the hull warm water current maybe making the metal expand
if somebody s aboard her already she ain t ours she s theirs bullshit that boat hasn t made steam for fifty years we found her she s ours
bullshit that boat hasn t made steam for fifty years we found her she s ours not in the eyes of the law
and what do you propose that we knock this guy off why not why the fuck not
what if that fucker finds it before we re ready to go we ll stand a watch four on eight off low man first
bodies re too fresh fresh ain t the first word that comes to mind
damn barbaric is what it is could be meant as a warning
that d be my guess so whoever did this might still be around
can t you use something else i might be able to find something on the ship but it s gonna take time
i might be able to find something on the ship but it s gonna take time do what you need to do just do it fast
what is it i think you better see this for yourself
you better get down here quick skipper i m on c deck cabin 400 what is it
on a passenger ship in 1953 if they knew what they were carrying
what do you propose for starters getting that gold off the ship what they don t know about isn t gonna bother them
i don t know what you re talking about i think you know
just what the hell do you think you re doing i don t know what you re talking about
i think you know maybe you can tell me then
the radio the radio oh yeah the radio
take it easy willya what about the radio you smashed it
don t lie to me what the fuck
what the fuck you didn t want us calling anybody too liable to ruin your big payday
you didn t want us calling anybody too liable to ruin your big payday i didn t touch the fucking radio
conveniently enough for you look i didn t touch it alright
i didn t touch the fucking radio ever occur to you there s somebody else on that boat skipper conveniently enough for you
what the hell happened turbine chamber on number two must ve blown took out part of the hull
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants if money can buy what he wants
if money can buy what he wants i don t figure there s much i want money can t buy
i don t figure there s much i want money can t buy then you re a lucky man
what s slow maybe twenty gallons an hour
morning everybody show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps showed him a hell of a lot more than that
showed him a hell of a lot more than that i bet you did
could be a fishing boat too big more like a freighter
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass he d let you off at the nearest port that s for sure
you mean before she sank cargo like this could make a crew think twice
then why didn t they take it probably didn t have time
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold that s what i call a payday
that s what i call a payday hell yeah
that s a good thing hell yeah i like it cold colder the better
sudden flashes of light i feel fine
stay away or else because of the gold
i don t even want to know what that s gonna taste like now better than starving to death
you okay yeah fine i just thought i heard something is all
the law s on our side if they want to challenge it let them try they must ve scuttled it nobody just lets a ship float away
so what did happen nobody knows there ve been a lot of theories of course but we ll never really know for sure
she was sailing up north right her destination was halifax yeah
nobody knows there ve been a lot of theories of course but we ll never really know for sure you think she s sailing without a crew
you re more practical than superstitious only way to be
maybe they didn t want it back maybe the whole fat deal was insured maybe but there s always somebody whose interest s at stake
why not call for help for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
take it easy you ll live longer did you see him
the guy he just came this way what guy
what guy there s somebody else on this boat
there s somebody else on this boat what what the hell re you talking about
what what the hell re you talking about i saw him just a minute ago some guy
i saw him just a minute ago some guy are you sure
are you sure of course i m sure i saw him
of course i m sure i saw him you sure it wasn t me
you sure it wasn t me it wasn t you it was somebody else there s somebody else aboard
so we find this guy and make a deal with him we don t exactly have the best bargaining position
no cowboy shit up there understand no cowboy shit right
you just shoot at something yeah just a bird just a stupid bird
he needs a doctor i ll call us in dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up keep an eye on him
how s he doing same any luck
same any luck no i ll try again later
you re saying they mutinied for the gold if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats only something must ve gone wrong
smashed it up pretty bad but who
the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill february first
february first the same day she supposedly went down
the same day she supposedly went down must not ve been the captain s entry he was probably out of the picture by then
collision with what the page s missing then their sos was real
their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision distress calls have been made collision with what
the page s missing then their sos was real but where s the damage
but where s the damage maybe the other ship took the worst of it
maybe the other ship took the worst of it if it was a ship she hit
it s not gonna hold us doesn t matter
it s a good bet they ll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too let em ask this ship s legally ours now
couldn t sleep wish i could say the same
what do you think happened on this boat i guess that s the sixty four thousand dollar question isn t it
i guess that s the sixty four thousand dollar question isn t it the what
are we smart enough to avoid that i don t know are we
when you found me yesterday at the pool i d seen something someone not our mystery guest again
not our mystery guest again no someone else a girl i m not sure she was real
what like some kind of ghost i don t know what else you d call her one second she was there the next she was gone
maybe hallucination is the wrong word it was more than that as though they were showing me showing you what
showing you what what happened
what happened maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims
no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims victims of what
victims of what something bad happened here murphy
that much i think we ve already established more than just a mutiny more than just the gold
something bad happened here murphy that much i think we ve already established
what s that supposed to mean i don t know
why you how come the rest of us haven t seen these people just lucky i guess
murphy to epps epps over
epps over either of you seen dodge
epps you there right here
what do we do with him leave him till we can get some help from now on nobody comes down here
over the gold maybe it was more than that
they went crazy crazy with greed not crazy not like him
hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water if the weather holds it might not be so bad
what happened we hit land
we re in an island chain it s only a matter of time before we hit another one greer s gone he broke out of the tank
and now you re gonna kill me is that it i didn t want it to turn out this way
i didn t want it to turn out this way murphy don t you see what s happening
murphy don t you see what s happening i think i see it pretty well
i think i see it pretty well it s the ship the ship s making you think this way
i don t give a damn about the gold i wish i could believe that either way you know what i ve done i ve got no choice
it s the ship the ship s making you think this way i know a little bit about human nature and what i ve seen only confirms that
of course they did let the buyer beware
let the buyer beware what do you say dodge
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia he ll sell the scrap for three times what he paid
he ll sell the scrap for three times what he paid i must be in the wrong business
i must be in the wrong business you got that right
you got that right better than making hamburger for mickey d
red sky at night sailor s delight red sky in morning sailor take warning
too deep to anchor out there looks like it s adrift
call the coastguard steer to one eight five let s check her out

how much you figure that s worth skipper hard to say maybe forty fifty million
hard to say maybe forty fifty million ho baby
if they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off not for fifty million an ocean liner maybe but fifty million in gold they come looking for
so what we gonna unload the gold and get a move on we leave it where it is stick to the plan
yeah but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka it s worth the effort believe me besides we re gonna need her to prove the salvage
i heard that dodge you gotta get on those repairs

what s the surprise in that this is africa it hasn t been that simple so far
it hasn t been that simple so far what have they done besides kill starling how many have they killed
i didn t conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger and it worked
and it worked in point of fact it didn t but i m convinced the theory is sound
understand i had help not a time for modesty bob
you re certain about tomorrow but you don t seem excited you don t enjoy killing do you
you don t enjoy killing do you then why do it
you never had it nigel and i don t like each other much
then he feasted on him starting with his feet please you needn t be so graphic

anything special about them just that they fart through their mouths must make kissing something of a gamble
just that they fart through their mouths must make kissing something of a gamble i ve lived in africa a year and i don t know what you know how long have you been here
i ve lived in africa a year and i don t know what you know how long have you been here almost three hours but i ve been getting ready all my life
samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts does he speak english
excellent could i see the bridge site i ve got medical supplies to deliver come along to the hospital when you re done
finish your tour and anxious to get started what is this mostly malaria
i don t suppose i could watch might be exciting for you
might be exciting for you i ve never been all that adventurous i wouldn t be in the way
i ve never been all that adventurous i wouldn t be in the way i d love the company and i ve hunted all my life
i d love the company and i ve hunted all my life well why not you seem so calm and experienced why not indeed
i m sure you mean that to be comforting but you ll have to deal with it nigel
you ll have to deal with it nigel that is precisely my plan but back in my tent
since you d only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions not to terrify you nigel but it s worse than you think i ve never even seen one
one shot so that s what a lion looks like
with much more on the way john we could have had this chat on flatter ground true enough but without the comedy relief
how lucky we are aren t we full of ourselves today i think it s because of the lion
aren t we full of ourselves today i think it s because of the lion possibly
all right thee second embankment will go there you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there
john it will not be easy nigel you ll just have to use your hands
but you said they were always old that s what the books say
what a good week you mean nobody died
i didn t have a chance to thank you what did i do
what did i do got me out of trouble
got me out of trouble nonsense samuel would have done something
nonsense samuel would have done something we need to talk

that s very considerate i m always considerate my mother taught me that
have you got it no but you do see you were needed after all and fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
i can try samuel says you killed a lion
samuel says you killed a lion it was probably luck i d rather you did the shooting
misfire it jammed has it ever done that before
has it ever done that before don t know
think about something else have you ever failed
have you ever failed only in life
goddammit it s all right stay ready they know it s there
but of course yours worked in point of fact it didn t but i m convinced the idea is sound
what happened to them i got big
their den have you ever seen anything like this nobody s seen anything like this lions don t have caves like this they re doing it for pleasure
where could it have gone how could it get across the water they re only lions yes don t they have to be
i ll have to i can t control mine i d be lost without the shame factor driving me
i can t control mine i d be lost without the shame factor driving me was that supposed to make me feel better
it s certainly the best chance they ve had to kill you you think they ll come then why
you think they ll come then why good luck
how many do you think they ve killed the most of any lions a hundred probably more johnny
i never thought i d say this but i m glad you came understood you realize now you could never have done it without me

afraid of lions it s all right samuel we all get hit
why do you laugh you don t believe she taught me i don t believe you had a mother

do you expect marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience that s difficult to say general
that s difficult to say general perhaps master galen you may say
then you d be out of a job gladly caesar
gladly caesar or perhaps into a new one but here s to your god and the courage of our legions
i would say there s nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what right is the dangerous man caesar is the man who doesn t care

this is the only place in rome where i thought i believed i was wholly in power narcissus will never support you caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament
where is my father where is the emperor and the army soldier
tribuus what happened in the arena was narcissus killed he must have been he was on the list of prisoners to be executed
why isn t he dead damn you you promised me he would be dead caesar i did my best the colosseum isn t under my control

i m a psychologist frank not a psychic what s this all about anyway what did dr fulton tell you
we re not sure what do you think he did
what do you think he did we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation
i m busy right now it s important
i see you re still having problems with your openings and this jeremy
and this jeremy edmonds i know you lost to karpov in 82 didn t you
no i told him to i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end but we heard him
but we heard him it could have been a tape a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself
anything else yes why disguise your voice if no one knows it
his home would be mount olympus call dispatch double the patrols i want that area blanketed
before we go in i gotta tell you this isn t going to be pretty i know that i ve seen the photo s
i know that i ve seen the photo s this ain t no photo
you never know how you re going to catch a suspect peter s right captain he s got to be forced into making a mistake
each of those grids represents almost a square mile that s a big area to cover
as large as castles yes why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure
what time did he get there about a quarter to one
he s right kathy what are you saying that i m seeing what i want to see that i m protecting a murderer what
we can t rely on your judgement anymore what does that mean
the most logical choice you don t have a shred of evidence
did you see his face no he was wearing a mask but i saw the cut on his wrist it was peter
i ve got a room at the institute i use when i stay late okay why don t you go out there we ll check in with you later
excuse me you said earlier that mary albert just moved in how long ago was that ten days ago

what have you come up with on the riddle wee willie winkie runs though the street we think he might be making a reference to himself
wee willie winkie runs though the street we think he might be making a reference to himself maybe but i don t think so i think it s just a tease
another one what word did he leave is did you tell him about the institute
as large as castles you are still light as air one hundred men can t move me it doesn t make sense
he s using the map as a chessboard the sonofabitch is playing chess with me how can he be playing chess with you you re not making any moves against him
how can he be playing chess with you you re not making any moves against him maybe i already have
it s a commercial area no one lives there but he had to dump the body there to make the move
a building a building isn t as light as air what s large but as light as air and can t be moved
he s not going to give us direct hints he s going to skirt around it he uses castles plural then says can t move me singular not can t move us
wait a minute there s an apartment in that area called the castle arms that s got to be it
where were you last night are we going to go through this again
are we going to go through this again answer the question
